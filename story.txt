Once upon a time there was a very enthusiastic UW Madison computer science student. He lived in Witte and was really enjoying Madison and the dorm. One day on his walk home from CS though, something super crazy happened!

It was late at night, and thus it was very dark and nobody else was out. Then a van pulled up next to him, somebody jumped out, put a hood over his head
and threw him in the van. The computer science student was extremly freightened and had no idea where the abductors were taking him.

Although he couldn't see it, he used his memory to open a program he had written on his mobile phone, able to send a distress signal to his family without any fuss, and send them their position. Soon, his family received a signal and called the police.

His body was shaking with dread, but he knew he would survive. When he suddenly  heard the police sirens in the distance, he felt relieved and recovered his consciousness. Finally, he was rescued, but he was there alone without any traces of the criminals. 

He then had an impulsive idea; quickly unlock the car door from the inside and jump out. There would be no way that his kidnappers would stop to grab him again if the cops were chasing them. So he did exactly that, and escaped.

The computer science student safely made it back to his house and his family was beyond happy to see him. In the end, he decided that he would transfer to Minnesota since the abduction kind of left a bad taste in his mouth toward Madison. The end!
