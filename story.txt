Once upon a time there was a very enthusiastic UW Madison computer science student. He lived in Witte and was really enjoying Madison and the dorm. One day on his walk home from CS though, something super crazy happened!

It was late at night, and thus it was very dark and nobody else was out. Then a van pulled up next to him, somebody jumped out, put a hood over his head
and threw him in the van. The computer science student was extremly freightened and had no idea where the abductors were taking him.
